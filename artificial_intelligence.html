            <h2>Challenges & My Solution:</h2>
            <p>The assignments wanted me to pick an AI from a book, comic book, or movie. However, I have never read/watched anything that had any kind of AI in it. So I decided to use ChatGPT as my AI of choice as it was free to use and I already knew a lot about it.</p>
